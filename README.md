Examples for getting started with LaTeX

## Software

### Linux

On Linux, I'm currently using [Kile](http://kile.sourceforge.net/) as an editor and [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) as a TeX system.

### Windows

When I still was using Windows for work, I used [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org/) as an editor and [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) as a TeX system.
